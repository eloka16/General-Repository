6 years ago, you’d have to be very brave to try to make or receive online payments in Nigeria.

Interswitch’s WebPay was the default payment processor and startups had to pay N150,000 (about $1,000 at the time) to acquire it. Even though mobile internet was the fastest-growing way to access the web, WebPay didn’t work on mobile phones. And then, there were the failure rates – some startups reported that as many as 90% of transactions failed.

Online payments didn’t work.

Furthermore, the Central Bank said that every online transaction had to be “tokenised” – confirmed by a one-time password. This meant recurring payments were impossible to execute. As a result, the only way to execute online subscription services was using premium SMS. This was restricted by another regulation, this time from the National Communications Commission capping transaction size at N200 (roughly $1). Telcos and their service provider partners used to charge a service fee that ranged from 60% to 80%.

All that has changed now.

Interswitch has upgraded WebPay and acquired Vanso (who developed MiMo). More importantly, startups like Paystack have brought truly simple web payments to startups across Nigeria – making recurring payments and payment pages available to anyone for free. Local founders are full of praise for Paystack, saying “it just works”. By the time Paystack got into Y Combinator, the startup became shorthand for modern payments in African tech.

##Tutorials github

Objective
Learn Git to keep track of your space station locations.

Mission Brief
Hoping to learn the ropes of Git? Good news cadet! You‘ve just been put in charge of running your team’s space stations. To complete your first mission, take advantage of what Git has to offer to track down all station locations.

Time	Audience	Prerequisites
30 minutes	You are new to Git and Bitbucket Cloud	You have installed Git
You have signed up for Bitbucket
Create a Git repository

As our new Bitbucket space station administrator, you need to be organized. When you make files for your space station, you’ll want to keep them in one place and shareable with teammates, no matter where they are in the universe. With Bitbucket, that means adding everything to a repository. Let’s create one!

Some fun facts about repositories

You have access to all files in your local repository, whether you are working on one file or multiple files.
You can view public repositories without a Bitbucket account if you have the URL for that repository.
Each repository belongs to a user account or a team. In the case of a user account, that user owns the repository. + In the case of a team, that team owns it.
The repository owner is the only person who can delete the repository. If the repository belongs to a team, an admin can delete the repository.
A code project can consist of multiple repositories across multiple accounts but can also be a single repository from a single account.
Each repository has a 2 GB size limit, but we recommend keeping your repository no larger than 1 GB.
Step 1. Create the repository
Initially, the repository you create in Bitbucket is going to be empty without any code in it. That‘s okay because you will start adding some files to it soon. This Bitbucket repository will be the central repository for your files, which means that others can access that repository if you give them permission. After creating a repository, you’ll copy a version to your local system—that way you can update it from one repo, then transfer those changes to the other.
